<H1>Notes about the WIN32 port of GNU REGEX</H1>

<P>This library provides a POSIX style regular expression
compilation and execution facility suitable for
use with C and C++ programs. See also
<a href="winregex.h">winregex.h</a> for other libraries.

<P>Download
<a href="gnu_regex.exe">gnu_regex.exe</a> (218k,
a self-extracting 
<a href="http://quest.jpl.nasa.gov/Info-ZIP/">info-zip</a>
archive) to
obtain all source code, project make files,
and some already compiled binaries.
Includes the h and lib files needed by
developers who compile against and link with the 
gnu_regex.lib library. The file regex.doc provides
documentation. At runtime of your application
the gnu_regex.dll is the only required component.
The test_gnu_regex.mak file can be used with
Microsoft Developer's Studio (VC++) to recompile
from sources.

<P>The original GNU sources are here:
<a href="ftp://gatekeeper.dec.com/GNU/regex-0.12.tar.gz">gatekeeper.dec.com</a>,
and this pointer satisfies the FSF license agreement
requirement to make a copy of the source code 
and the FSF Copyright statement available to recipients
of executable versions. 

<P>Here is the gnu regex documentation formatted as
html <a href="http://www.math.utah.edu/docs/info/regex_toc.html">regex_toc.html</a>.

<P>
After searching a few places on the internet I
could not find a WIN32 port of any kind of REGEX.
Therefore I obtained the GNU REGEX and did the port
myself and have made the binaries and some additional
sources available on the web. The resulting gnu_regex.dll
is useful with my scheme interpreter 
<a href="http://people.delphi.com/gjc/siod.html">SIOD</a>
and other purposes in general.
If there are better implementations of regular
expression facilities available please let me know.
I also ported the Henry Spencer regex and found it
satisfactory, faster in some cases, slower in others,
see <a href="hs_regex.html">hs_regex.html</a>.

<LI>I used gnu regex-0.12.tar.gz, extracting the files
    regex.h and regex.c.
<LI>I used Microsoft Developer Studio Standard Edition
    version 4.0
<LI>The main project is a console application, 
    test_gnu_regex
    which includes gnu_regex dll as a subproject. 
	General project settings must
	be edited to make sure that all the intermediate
	files (for both project and subproject) go into
	the same directories. Establishing project/subproject
	relationships is tricky but well worth the effort
	in terms of convenience later.
<LI>Insert the files gnu_regex.def and regex.c into
    the gnu_regex.dll project. Insert test_regex.c into
	the test_gnu_regex.exe project.
<LI>Project C/CC+ settings must include the following
    preprocessor defintions: REGEX_MALLOC,STDC_HEADERS,
	in all build configurations of gnu_regex.
<LI>There are dozens of compiler warnings, including
signed/unsigned mismatch, const qualifier differences,
and pointer mismatches. None of which seem to matter, at least
on the intel platform. No modifications to the FSF
supplied sources regex.c or regex.h are required
if you are willing to ignore the compiler warnings.
<LI>The file release.bat creates the compressed tar
files which make up the distribution I have posted
to the web.
